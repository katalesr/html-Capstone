    <h3>If you are one of them, you have a great creative imagination</h3>
      <p><b>Genius:</b> An intellectual power of a sublime type, such as that attributed to those<br>
        who are considered the greatest practitioners in any branch of art, meditation, or application.<br> 
        Terman and Hollingworth used the term genius to denote children with high intelligence,<br> as Terman considered 
        each student of the sample that he studied and followed up <br>about 35 years, got +140 IQ points
        in the Stanford-Binet test among geniuses.</p>
    
    
    <p><b>Talent:</b> complex features that qualify the individual for high achievement in some<br>
        skills and jobs, and the gifted is the individual who has an innate aptitude<br>
        and is cultivated by the appropriate environment, so talent often<br>
        appears in a specific field such as music, poetry, drawing, or even quick intuition... and others.</p>
    <p><b>Creativity:</b> the production of new, rare, different, useful thought or action, and thus depends on tangible achievement.</p>
    <p><b>Intelligence:</b> the general overall ability to perform intentional action, think rationally, and interact adequately with the<br>
         environment. Intelligence is the capabilities of the individual in several areas, such as high abilities in<br> 
         vocabulary and numbers, concepts and problem-solving, the ability to benefit from experiences, and learn new information.</p>
